# YIQAM 

A C++ project developed using Turbo C++ IDE to solve physics problems related to the three equations of motion for 9th standard students.

## Overview

This project is an object-oriented approach to solving physics problems based on the three equations of motion. It reads initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time from user input or files and calculates the missing parameter.

## Features

- Object-oriented design for easy maintenance and extensibility.
- Read data from files to access previous problems and solutions.
- Interactive user interface for input and output.
- Helps students practice and understand the concepts of kinematics.

## Usage

1. Install Turbo C++ IDE (if not already installed).
2. Open the project in Turbo C++.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to input data and obtain solutions.

## Compatibility

This project was developed using Turbo C++ IDE, an older version of C++. It might require adjustments to work with modern C++ compilers.
